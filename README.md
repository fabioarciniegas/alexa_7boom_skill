# alexa_7boom_skill
A skill that allows Alexa to play the game "7 boom" with you.

7 boom is a simple game where you alternate saying numbers sequentially except if the number contains a 7 or is multiple of 7, in which case you must say "boom."

e.g.

1,2,3,4,5,6,boom,8,9,10,11,12,13,boom,15,16,boom,18,19,20,boom ...etc.

TODO: what is the best way to include other numbers into the game?
